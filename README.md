# VPS Dockerized GitOps Deployment

This repository is designed for managing and deploying containerized applications using GitOps principles. It supports **VPS** setups by providing Docker-based service configurations and seamless Git-based automation using tools like [Komodo](https://komo.do/docs/intro). Each branch in this repository represents a self-contained deployment for a specific service or stack.

---

## üöÄ Features

- Declarative Docker configurations for individual services or stacks.
- GitOps-powered continuous deployment.
- Support for orphan-branch model to isolate deployments.
- Works across different VPS environments.
- Bash helpers to streamline branch and deployment workflows.

---

## üì¶ Requirements

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and Docker Compose
- A GitOps tool like [Komodo](https://komo.do/docs/intro) configured with webhook or polling
- A target server (VPS) with Docker runtime

---

## üìÅ Repository Structure

Each **branch** represents an independent service (e.g., `Nginx`, `Nextcloud`, `Jellyfin`) and contains:

```
.
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ docker-compose.yml     # Main service definition
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .env                   # Optional environment variables
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ setup.sh               # Optional initialization scripts
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md              # Service-specific notes
```

> ‚úÖ Using orphan branches keeps service deployments clean, focused, and version-controlled.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://{{git-source}}/{{user-name}}/{{repo-name}}.git
cd {{repo-name}}
```

### 2. Create a New Orphan Branch

```bash
git checkout --orphan <ServiceName>
```

> üìõ **Branch Naming Convention:**  
> Use a simple service name like `Nginx`, `Jellyfin`, `Plex`, etc.

---

### 3. Configure Your Service

- Edit `docker-compose.yml` and supporting files.
- Add `.env` for custom environment values if needed.
- Optionally include setup scripts (e.g., `setup.sh`).

Then:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add deployment for <ServiceName>"
```

---

### 4. Push the Branch

```bash
git push origin <ServiceName>
```

---

### 5. Set Up GitOps Tool

I recommend [Komodo](https://komo.do/docs/intro), but any GitOps-compatible tool will work.

**Steps:**

1. Configure the GitOps tool to monitor your repo or a specific branch.
2. Set up a webhook or enable polling for automated triggers.
3. Choose deployment mode: auto-sync or manual approvals.
4. Test deployment by pushing a small change.

üß™ **Verify:** Ensure the GitOps tool detects changes and updates the deployment automatically.

---

## üß∞ Bash Helpers

Useful aliases and functions for managing Git branches and deployments. Add to `.bashrc`, `.zshrc`, or `.bash_aliases`.

### Pull All Branches and Sync

```bash
alias pullall='
git fetch --prune --all && \
current_branch=$(git branch --show-current); \
for local_branch in $(git branch --format="%(refname:short)"); do \
  if ! git show-ref --verify --quiet refs/remotes/origin/$local_branch; then \
    echo "üßπ Deleting local branch $local_branch (no longer exists on origin)..."; \
    git branch -D $local_branch; \
  fi; \
done; \
for remote_branch in $(git branch -r | grep -v "\->" | sed "s|origin/||"); do \
  if git show-ref --verify --quiet refs/heads/$remote_branch; then \
    echo "üîç Checking branch $remote_branch (already exists locally)..."; \
    ahead=$(git rev-list --left-right --count $remote_branch...origin/$remote_branch | awk "{print \$1}"); \
    behind=$(git rev-list --left-right --count $remote_branch...origin/$remote_branch | awk "{print \$2}"); \
    if [ "$ahead" = "0" ] && [ "$behind" != "0" ]; then \
      echo "  ‚è© Fast-forwarding $remote_branch..."; \
      git update-ref refs/heads/$remote_branch refs/remotes/origin/$remote_branch; \
    elif [ "$ahead" = "0" ] && [ "$behind" = "0" ]; then \
      echo "  ‚úÖ $remote_branch is already up-to-date."; \
    else \
      echo "  ‚ö†Ô∏è $remote_branch has diverged! Needs manual pull/merge."; \
    fi; \
  else \
    echo "üå± Creating missing local branch $remote_branch tracking origin/$remote_branch..."; \
    git branch $remote_branch origin/$remote_branch; \
  fi; \
done; \
git checkout $current_branch'
```

### Orphan Branch Creator

```bash
orphan() {
    if [ -z "$1" ]; then
        echo "Usage: orphan <branch-name>"
        return 1
    fi
    git checkout --orphan "$1"
}
```

### Enable Git Autocompletion

```bash
source /usr/share/bash-completion/completions/git
```

## üîí VPS-Specific Security Considerations

Unlike managed platforms, VPS environments often expose **all ports by default**, leaving services vulnerable if not properly secured. Always follow these practices when deploying on a VPS:

### üöß 1. Restrict Open Ports

Only open ports that your services require. Common ports:

| Service         | Port     |
| --------------- | -------- |
| HTTP            | 80       |
| HTTPS           | 443      |
| SSH             | 22       |
| Custom Services | _custom_ |

Use your firewall to restrict all others.

---

### üõ°Ô∏è 2. Enable and Configure Firewall

#### On Ubuntu/Debian (UFW):

```bash
#!/bin/sh

# Fetch Cloudflare IPs (both IPv4 and IPv6)
cf_ips=$(curl -s https://www.cloudflare.com/ips-v4) || {
    echo "Failed to fetch Cloudflare IPv4 IPs"
    exit 1
}
cf_ips="$cf_ips $(curl -s https://www.cloudflare.com/ips-v6)" || {
    echo "Failed to fetch Cloudflare IPv6 IPs"
    exit 1
}

# Allow traffic from Cloudflare IPs on ports 80 (HTTP) and 443 (HTTPS)
for cfip in $cf_ips; do
    ufw allow proto tcp from $cfip to any port 80 comment 'Cloudflare IP on port 80'
    ufw allow proto tcp from $cfip to any port 443 comment 'Cloudflare IP on port 443'
done

# Allow SSH from anywhere (port 22)
ufw allow 22 comment 'Allow SSH from anywhere'

# Reload UFW
ufw reload >/dev/null || {
    echo "Failed to reload UFW"
    exit 1
}
echo "UFW rules updated to allow Cloudflare traffic on ports 80 and 443, and SSH from anywhere"
```

---

### üõë 3. Docker and UFW: Hidden Risk

By default, **Docker directly modifies iptables**, which can **bypass UFW rules**, even if you've locked down ports with UFW. This means containers may be **exposed to the public internet**, despite appearing protected.

To mitigate this risk, follow these steps:

#### üîê Mitigation: Disable Docker's iptables Manipulation

Add this to `/etc/docker/daemon.json`:

```json
{
  "iptables": false
}
```

Then restart Docker:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart docker
```

> üõë **Warning:** You must manually manage iptables or UFW rules for container networking after disabling Docker‚Äôs iptables behavior.

#### üß∞ Optional: UFW-Docker Workaround Script

If you prefer to let UFW manage your Docker networking, consider using the [`ufw-docker`](https://github.com/chaifeng/ufw-docker) script:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/chaifeng/ufw-docker.git
cd ufw-docker
sudo ./install.sh
```

---

### ‚òÅÔ∏è 4. Provider-Specific Port Rules

#### üü¢ **AWS EC2**

- Use **Security Groups**.
- Allow only required ports to `0.0.0.0/0` (or restrict to specific IP ranges).
- Example: allow ports 22, 80, 443 in the EC2 dashboard.

#### üîµ **Oracle Cloud Free Tier**

- Must **manually allow ingress ports** in:
  - **VNIC security list**
  - **Network Security Groups**
- Default only allows SSH (22). Add:
  - TCP 80 (HTTP)
  - TCP 443 (HTTPS)
  - TCP for your app port(s) as needed

#### üî∂ **DigitalOcean / Linode / Hetzner**

- Usually no firewall by default ‚Äî you‚Äôre fully exposed.
- Install and configure `ufw` or `iptables` immediately after provisioning.

---

### üß∑ 5. Additional Best Practices

- Use **SSH keys** instead of passwords.
- Disable **root login** via SSH.
- Regularly **update and patch** (`unattended-upgrades` on Debian/Ubuntu).
- Install **Fail2Ban** to mitigate brute-force attacks:
  ```bash
  sudo apt install fail2ban
  sudo systemctl enable fail2ban
  ```
